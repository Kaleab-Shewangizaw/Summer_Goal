# Summer_Goal
I built this app during **final exam season** to prepare for my **rest period**—a time I wanted to use wisely to grow both personally and professionally. I needed a simple yet effective system to:

- 📚 Plan what **skills** I want to learn,
- 💡 Organize the **projects** I want to build,
- ⚙️ Track my **daily consistency**, and
- 🧘 Reflect on my progress day by day.

A full-stack productivity and goal-tracking application where users can create personal plans, track their progress daily, and reflect on their journey. Designed to encourage consistency and accountability through visual feedback like progress bars and contribution grids.

## 🚀 Features
